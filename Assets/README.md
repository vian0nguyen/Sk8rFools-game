## Upload New Assets

They go in the `Sprite` folder. It's pretty self-explanatory but to lay it out.

- *SPRITES_Environment*: non interactive set piece assets
- *SPRITES_Objects*: interactive objects
- *SPRITES_Characters*: assets that talk or can move!

## Update Assets

You can reupload the same asset, make sure it retains the same name and the same size! It will populate in the game project updated with the saved scaling and position details.
